  Due date:         before midnight on the night of Friday, April 27
  Submission:       use handin.cs.clemson.edu to turn in a source file
  Late penalty:     10% off per day late, up to five days
  Tools needed:     gcc (or other language)
  Concepts needed:  set associative caches

  This is an individual assignment.


A simple cache simulator is given (bsim.c) that reads in byte addresses
from a file and prints the cache miss count and hit rate. The simulator
uses a 64 byte line size for an 8-way set-associative cache with total
size of 32 KiB.

The input will be redirected on the command line from a test file. The
test file will consist of 8-digit hex values, one per line, that are
32-bit memory addresses taken from the memory access trace for a
benchmark program. For example, the first five lines of the test file
sc10k are:

    00002020
    00002024
    ffffe860
    00002028
    0000202c

You task is to revise the simulator to accept line size values of 4, 8,
16, 32, and 64 as a command line parameter. The value will be specified
as -4, etc., so that the simulator can be run with command lines of

	./a.out -4 < sc10k
	./a.out -8 < sc10k
	./a.out -16 < sc10k

etc., where < is input file redirection and sc10k is the name of the
input file. (The simulator must conform to this usage pattern to receive
full credit. E.g., you must not change the program to read the test file
name as a command line parameter nor to prompt the user to enter the file
name.)

Line sizes other than 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 are invalid and will not be
tested.

Regardless of the line size value chosen, the simulated cache must remain
as 32 KiB in total size. (That is, the choice of a 32 byte line size must
not somehow result in simulating only a 16 KiB cache.) This allows the
line size to be studied as an independent design choice.

For the test files gcc10k, sc10k, and swm10k, the miss counts are:

	line	----- trace file -----
	size	gcc10k	sc10k	swm10k
	4	1803	775	1951
	8	1017	431	1052
	16	613	257	600
	32	364	161	354
	64	214	102	214
